## General Program overview.

This program was developed to serve as a prototype for an online quiz project. As a prototype, it has not yet been integrated with the database, and some of its pages remain static, such as the admin page and certain features on the teacher's page.

Upon accessing the website, users will be directed to the index.html page, which serves as the login page. If the user does not have an account, they can easily create one by selecting the sign up button. Once the user has entered their username and password, they will be redirected to the home page. From there, the user can select one of the three available tests, and will be directed to the test page where they will find the start button. Upon clicking the start button, the test will begin, with its duration determined by the teacher who created it. We have included two questions per exam as an example, with a duration of one minute for each test.

Teachers who have logged in can access the dashboard page via the navigation bar, a feature that is not available to regular users. The dashboard allows teachers to manage tests, create new ones, modify existing tests, and view statistics.

In addition, there is a separate page for site administrators, who have the ability to manage the website as a whole. They can view tests, manage users, and perform other administrative tasks.

Finally, there is an "About Us" page that provides some background information about the website and its purpose.
